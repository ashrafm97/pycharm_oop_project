## What is OOP & Why OOP?

How to OOP: 

Learning outcomes:
Class
What is a class? A class is like a cookie cutter or blue print for objects but not the object itself.

What can you do with a cookie? - eat it!

###Methods
The actions or how an object behaves.

So in the above example, .eat_cookie() could be a method inside the class Cookie

###Instance

What is an instance?

###Syntax

````python
print("")
````

- Convention - capitalise the first letter of Classes, like Dog over dog
#4 Pillars 

###Inheritance

The ability of a subclass to inherit all the behaviours and methods from the parent class.

One of the reasons we use OOP, as it means you write less and less code, the deeper you go.

This is debatable, as you end up having to adapt a lot methods anyway.

Depends on how good of a coder you are and your ability to abstract effectively. 
###Abstraction
- good naming conventions
- good documentation (readme pushed to git a lot)
- use of inheritance pillar
###Polymorphism
- what is class polymorphism?
- what is method polymorphism?
